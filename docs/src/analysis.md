# Analysis

The framework provides a set of tools and methods to analyze the trees.

- Visualization: The framework uses graphviz to visualize the tree in svg format.
- Tracing: The tracing enables to see how the tree is traversed step by step.
- Simulation: The simulation enables to replace the real implementations with a small stubs and run the tree.
